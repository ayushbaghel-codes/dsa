### Step 1: Restate the problem
“Let me restate the problem to ensure I understand it correctly…”
- Briefly explain the input
- Briefly explain the expected output
### Step 2: Clarify constraints & edge cases
Speak for ten to fifteen seconds about what you consider.
- Possible edge cases.
- Input size constraint.
- Duplicate, negative or empty cases.
- Return behavior.
**Goal:** Show that you think like a real engineer
### Step 3: Present the brute force approach first.
Explain the simplest possible method.
Include: 
- How it works (1-2 sentences)
- Time complexity.
- Why it is not ideal?
**Never skip through force - interviewers want to see your evolution.**
### Step 4: Present the optimized approach.
This is your main solution.
Explain:
- The key idea or insight
- Which data structure you will use
- Why this is more efficient
- how it fixes the brute force limitations
**This part matters the most, make it clean and simple.**
### Step 5: Walk through a small example.
Pick the sample input or create your own. Work step by step through your optimized logic.
**This proves you actually understand the approach.**
### Step 6: State time and space complexity.
End with confidence:
1. “Time complexity will be O(-)”
2. “Space complexity will be O(-)”
### Step 7: Discussed alternatives, trade offs, if any.
Say something like:
~ If space was a concern, we could also use ___ but at the cost of___.

End with  **“that's the optimised approach I would implement for this problem.”**
